    % Bit 9â€•Data modified indicator. If phasor data in frame is modified by a post-processing device such as a
    % PDC, this bit shall be set to 1. This shall include data points inserted by interpolation or lost point
    % reconstruction, and data modified by down-sampling methods, offset adjustment, or error correction. In all
    % other cases this bit shall be set to 0. It shall not be used to indicate conversions such as polar-rectangular
    % and integer-floating point.
